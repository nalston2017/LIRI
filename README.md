Homework #10 node js command line assignment

LIRI is a command line application that can search through twiiter, spotify, and OMDB and displaying the results in the command line.

All results will also be saved in the log.txt file located on the GitHub page.

First type node liri.js then:

- For a twitter search type "my-tweets" + any twitter username to call the last 20 tweets of that user. The default username is "FiftyShades".

- For a spotify search type "spotify-this-song" + any song title to return song title and info that meet your request".

 - For a OMDB search type "movie-this" + a movie title will bull in information for that movie. The default movie is "Mr. Nobody."

- The "do-what-it-says" will call the song 'I Want It That Way' by the Backstreet Boys."

The only catch is to put all requests in quotation marks or else LIRI will not be able to understand you.
